Credits
The code is GPL'ed and a fork of the no longer developed Dashalytics which is based on TanTanâ€™s Google Analytics plugin for Wordpress and uses the Keychain plugin from Scue, a tooltip by Nick Stakenburg and a glider by MissingMethod .
I picked up development in 2010 primarly with the goal of making it work again since the last release was from 2008 and around 2009 google changed the formats for the reports rendering it unfunctional. After getting it to work i cleaned and bugfixed the code a bit and in the future might implement new features, but mostly i will make sure it never stops working again.
